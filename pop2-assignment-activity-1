Assignment Activity 1: Mastermind Game
--------------------------------------
This program simulates the Mastermind game. The computer generates a random 4-digit code, and the user has 15 attempts to guess it.
After each guess, feedback is provided:
- 'R' indicates a correct digit in the correct position.
- 'Y' indicates a correct digit in the wrong position.
- 'B' indicates an incorrect digit.
